    <h3>Monday, 02.10.2023</h3>
    <p>Directly on my first lab day, I went to check out a bouldering gym close by the University called 'La Roca'. It had a lot of positive reviews and looked really cute so I just went there but also was really nervous, because I new I would go there alone and don't know anyone and I really wanted to find some friends for bouldering. </p>
    <p>The bouldering hall itself is located in an area with a lot of Industry and also looks like an industry building itself, so first I did not even find it. It then has two rooms: One with all the routes, the coffeemachine etc and the other one with a gym and some spray walls, which also has open access to members 24/7.</p>

    <p>I think I might have a pretty harsh german accent, because as soon as I started talking to the guy at the reception, he directly asked me wether I would be german. When I said yes and then told hom that I've only been here for 4 days, he got very excited and wanted me to wait a moment. A few seconds later, Markus arrived and apparently he not only works there, but also he just arrived in Melbourne after living in Hamburg for 16 months. He showed me the hall and we chatted a bit and afterwards I directly felt better.</p>
    <p>I started bouldering then and after ~30 min my underarms already felt weak because I made to less pauses. And while I was massaging them a guy asked me if I would be okay and so we started chatting. His name is Ryan and in the end we added each other on Instagram so be able to go bouldering together another time. We also talked with some other guys that were quite funny but then also went home again very fast. They told me everybody who moves to Melbourne will stay here and so I should directly get a membership for a whole year. :D</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Thursday, 05.10.2023</h3>
    <p>Ryan had wrote me that he will go on thursday again, so I decided to also go a second time this week. I had to stay in the lab a bit longer so when I arrived Ryan had only half an hour left until he had to go home. We only managed to talk a bit sadly, but directly afterwards I got to know Imogen who directly offered me self-baked cookies and Will with whom I also exchanged numbers. He asked if he can join some runs and offered to take us to Lysterfield Park on Sunday so that was amazing!</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Tuesday, 10.10.2023</h3>
    <p>Third time bouldering. I met Ryan again and we had such a fun time together. He is really good at making bad jokes but then also hyping me up when I try to set a route so that was very cute. From his instagram picutres + the two hours I talked with him until now I think he has a really interesting personality so I hope I will get to know him more in the future.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Thursday, 12.10.2023</h3>
    <p>Today I could leave work earlier and so arrived at 'La Roca' already an hour earlier than Will and Jono. I started with some weight training because I hope it will help with my running. Then I started bouldering earlier and also met Mitch there again. So we bouldered all together. </p>
    <p>Also today Will and Jono brought a lot of friends today so I tried catching up with all the names the whole evening.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Monday, 16.10.2023</h3>
    <p>Today I was supposed to meet Ryan, but he was there with a lot of other friends and then  I also met Mitch again, so I did not talk with him a lot sadly. On the other hand I managed to talk with Mitch a lot and got to know him better and then also exchanged numbers with him to meet him again on Saturday so I made a new friend today.</p>
    <p>Also I talked to Markus again. I did not see him the last times and he always talks to me in german so he will not forget those language skills. But it is really nice that exceptionally it is not me struggeling to find all the right words. </p>
    <br>

    <h3>Thursday, 19.10.2023</h3>
    <p>It starts that I rerally get to know a lot of people. Today I not only met Mitch, Ryan, Imogen, Will, Jono,.... again, but also met Jeff, who is not only a really good climber, but also has a lot of the same interests that I have and at the moment does his pdh also at clayton campus. I didn't talk a lot to Ryan today, which I was kind of sad about (but he was also there with his whole friend group), but then Will and his friend group decided to go for an ice cream afterwards and asked if we (Mitch and me) would like to join and so we drove to Oakleigh, aet A LOT of ice cream and sat in a park and just chilled for another hour. Afterwards Imogen walked me back to the train station (she really is one of the kindest and cutest persons I ever met) and then I drove home and did not need to each any lunch anymore.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Monday, 23.10.2023</h3>
    <p>I had wrote Ryan to meet him at the climbing gym again but then discovered that I forgot to bring my sportswear with me. Since I wanted to treat myself with good shorts for running either way (I only have leggins so far), I decided to leave an hour earlier to buy the sportsstuff and then use them directly for bouldering. I still arrived late, which is unfortunate because Ryan always leaves again after 1.5 hours (apparently he has to study each evening but that sounds a bit sad right?), but we still had one hour again and also all the other people I got to kow already were there. In the end I talked quite a lot with Jeff, who did not tell me that it was his birthday that day (I just saw it on Instagram later).</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Wednesday, 25.10.2023</h3>
    <p>I forgot to write about this day and now the only thing I can remember is that I went bouldering and that I finally managed to do one of my projects and afterwards was shaky for more then 20 min. And this shows me again why it is so important to directly write down everything that happends.</p> 
    <br>

    <h3>Monday, 30.11.2023</h3>
    <p>Today was amazing! Kind of everybody that I know (except Jeff and Imogen) was there and Mitch brought Brownies he had made himself and I met Ryan's friends and they invited me to 'Esoteric' festival and then Ryan said he will ask his cousin who works there if he can get a cheaper ticket for me over him (which really worked out later on and how I had to pay 70$ less then regular!!). THen Mitch said I can bake German CHristmas cookies at his place and then we can make a german Christmas party with everybody and drink mold wine (which will be great when it has 25 degrees I guess) and in the end Jono and Markus helped me with my project and gave some really good advices and then Jono and Will drove me home. So all in all a very good day!</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Thursday, 02.11.2023</h3>
    <p>Originally Laura and Viki had planned to join me at La Roca so they would meet all the other people and see where I disappear to twice a week, but then they both had really long lab days and so they did not manage to join sadly. But we just postponed it for a week. Also we wanted to get donoughts afterwards, but then we decided to also postpone that so that Viki and Laura would be there and instead just train longer.</p>
    <p>While Jono is really helping me with my climbing technic, it turned out that Alex worked as a personal trainer before and when I told him I would like to get stronger, he just decided to train me. So we alltogether did a weight training and strech session afterwards. As I already knew before, it turned out that I just have weak arms, so probably we will work on that the next weeks.</p>
    <p>Imogen brought cherry cookies this time and as always they were amazing. And also she always keeps two for Jono in the end, because he never takes some during climbing. Especially when the slab wall is new you can only find him there.</p>

    <h3>Thursday,09.11.2023</h3>
    <p>Today I had to stay in the lab until 6:30 pm and was super tired, but the boys were so nice to pick me up, gave me something to eat at their appartment and then we drove over to La Roca, where we met Laura and Viki. They had managed to leave a bit earlier today and managed to join us. In La Roca you can bring somebody in for free once a month if you have a membership, and Mitch offered to be the second person who gave his "bring-your-friend-in" to them. Even rental shoes are included, so it is really nice for people who want to try out climbing. Anna (who works there) showed them around and then Will of course took over to go climbing with them (I think I have actually never met someone beeing to welcoming before). They both did amazing and also had so much fun that they did not want to stop until the gym closed and so Jono and Will offered to grab some donuts for all of us and then pick us up again. With the donuts and Mitch we went to the beach again for a swim and then afterwards brought Laura and Viki back to our appartment where I collected some stuff and then slept at the boy's appartment, because I had to be in the lab by 7:45 and they just live so much closer (it only takes 5 min to get to university compared to 55 min).</p>
    <br>

    <br>

    <h3>Thursday, 21.12.2023</h3>
    <p>I haven't written anything about the last month of bouldering, because I was too frustrated. I had joined a climbing comp (just a fun one), but then fell and hurt my elbow and then I couldn't boulder for the next weeks and was not in the mood to write about bouldering anymore. But today was the first day where I could actually do "real climbing" again without needing to stopp everytime I did something hard. Chris, Mitch, Alex and Will were also there and I met multiple new people over Will the last weeks, so it was a lot of fun and made me really happy. It will probably still take a while until I am back at full strength, but that is fine. Alex and I also suddenly reached a weird sibling-level, where he annoys me the whole time by randomly touching my hair or face and just prickling me in general.</p>
    <p>Afterward we went home shortly (I moved in with the boys, so we finally really have the same house) and ate donuts that Will brought home from his work. Then we picked up Marcus and went to COles to buy bleach and hair color and afterwards met Alex and Chris at Alex's dad hair salon to dye Jono's hair again. This time we used purple and blue to color his hair and then drew lines in it with bleach. While doing that we also kept annoying each other and sprayed each other with water / tried to knock over each other. In the end it took until 2 am until everything was finished and Will had already collapsed an hour ago and just sat in a chair in silence. But at 2 am even Jono started to feel tired, so we hurried up and went to bed.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
   
    <h3>Wednesday, 10.01.2023</h3>
    <p>The last five days I finally woke up without pain in my elbow, so it was the first session where I could actually try hard things again.
    Jono had already shown me how to warm up properly, so I don't injure my elbow again directly and I am doing that now every time at the beginning of a session.
    Today was very crowded and hot and I didn't finish a single new climb, but I climbed a lot in general so I still consider that a success.
    I also decided that I have to give myself at least a week of proper training before I allow myself to get annoyed on how weak I got.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Thursday, 11.01.2023</h3>
    <p>Vera joined us at La Roca for the first time today. It was the perfect day to join because in comparison to normaly it was extremely empty. Will sadly couldn't join climbing because he is still sick (this damn german cold that Fabi brought to Australia), but he showed her around nevertheless. I managed to do two pull-ups again for the first time, so I might officially be strong enough to climb interesting stuff again. Now I can hopefully start with some blue-tag projects soon. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Sunday, 14.01.2023</h3>
    <p>After we came home from the Alpine National Park, Will, Jono and I directly went to La Roca again and it was absolutely empty. But Marucs and some other guys that Will and Jono are friends with were there and so we climbed until the gym closed at 7 pm and then went upstairs to the staff room where everyone kind of did whatever they wanted (which ment painting Minis for Jono and Marucs and writing for Will). I looked through all of Jono's small gemstones, because apparently he had collected them when he was younger, but doesn't need them anymore
    and offered Will and me that we could try to make us some jewelly with wire and those gemstones. So the next step will be finding out how to actually do the jewelly.</p>
    <p>The climbing itself was also great, a did a proper warm-up, climbed a little bit and then joined Jono on the moon board (which I never did before in Melbourne) and it is absolutely great. Other than most people I like the holds and also the movements, because it is too close to the ground to actually injure yourself. 
    I am still too weak to actually finish a climb, but it is still a lot of fun and apparently you will get stronger really fast. SO let's see.</p>
