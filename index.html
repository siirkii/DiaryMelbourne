<h3>Digital Diary about living in Melbourne</h3>
<p>Hello friends, family and future me to my small own Website! Here I just want to write down everything that I experience so I won't have problems later on to remember everything. I will be here in Melbourne for 5 month to do my internship about dendritic cells (hopefully in a few weeks I will be able to describe that further) and afterwards some travelling around Australia.</p>
<p>The part of the university the lab is at is at Clayton campus, which is pretty far away from the city centre and therefore always takes me up to 50 min to get there, but that is also always the perfect time to call friends or read a bit, so I am starting my day most of the time like that. Clayton Campus itself is really huge (it feels like an own small village) and has multiple own small streets and a small "shopping centre" (mostly for food though). Also it is very green and artsy, which I personally really like. But I am already curious to see how green it still is in the summer. The builiding I am in is part od the 'Medicine Discovery Institute' and the adress is 15 Innovation Walk. In the same building there is also a coffee shop which really has the best coffee from all I tried to far, and it even has reusable coffee mugs (which sadly is not that common in Australia so at some point I will need to buy myself one to then bring it with me). </p>

<p>The people in the lab are all really open and friendy. My working group is rather small (without me only four other people atm), but they share all rooms and the lab with two other small working groups and also have lab meetings together usw, so it feels more like a big working group with all of them together. I get supervised by Peck, who is a post-doc originally from Singapore. She is really open and extroverted, likes to makes jokes and always tells me that she doesn't expect me to remember a lot because she herself keeps forgetitng things and then keeps on telling me about all the dumb little mistakes she already did in the lab.
</p>
<p>In general everybody calls the other with their first names, also professors, and you don't have to wait until they ask you to do it, it is just normal to do it that way. And they also directly talk with you about personal stuff and make jokes etc. so the atmosphäre is really chill. That does not keep them away from working up to 60 hours a week though. But often the same amount spent at work does still feel less stressfull here compared to Germany, because while working the atmosphäre is just more relaxed.</p>
<br>
<p>I will try to update this website as often as possible and write down everything interesting that is happening to me / us, so just scroll around and have a look!</p>
