    <h1 class="headline"  style="background-color: rgb(254, 207, 119)">Half Marathon Training</h1>

    <p>Shortly before the start of our internship, we had a two-days-Retreat with our Masters cohort to talk about the last year. In the evening next to free barbecue there was also free wine and after 1-2 glasses all the five of us that would spent their internship in Melbourne decided to start a new hobby and run a half marathon together. Without thinking twice we directly signed up (only Christina had a few concerns but then she was also the first one that signed up and the next minutes nearly had a panic attack because she was anxious we would just leave her run it alone) and so it was set: We would run 21,2km on the 3rd of December 2023. We have to not here that except of Ronja, nobody of us was a runner when you don't count 5k every few weeks. But we still had 9 weeks to train for it in Melbourne, so we felt at least enough confidence that we would be able to do it.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Saturday, 30.09.2023</h3>
    <p>The first day after I had arrived in Australia, Laura, Viki and I decided to go on a short 5k run just close to our appartment. But since it was 27Â°C outside and the area we live in is quit hilly, those 5k were really exhausting and we had to go really slow. We still finished, but with a pace of 7:13/km. </p>
    <br>

   <h3>Sunday, 01.10.2023</h3>
   <p>Our second run was then directly the day after, we planned again for 5k but this time at the beautiful Albert Park, bacause Viki read it would be exactly 5km to go around the lake once. In reality it was more 4.8k, but still, the park was really good for runs. Also we went at the evening so we could see the sunset while running. The only disadvantage this place has, is that we have to drive 25min from our appartment to get there and after work, this is quit stressfull. On the other hand it might get easier with summer when the days get longer.</p>

   <p>Because this time we felt so good while running, we decided to do an intervall training afterwards with 5x400m and 1.5min rest in between. But because I failed to choose the right program on my watch, we even had to do one times more 400m then suggested. Afterwards I felt extremly exhausted but also really good that I finished it. Bu we all agreed that we would need some rest days now.</p>

   <h3>Wednesday, 04.10.2023</h3>
   <p>That day was the first time we tried to run after work. Since most of the das we are really in the lab until 16:30-17:30 and then at least I need almost one hour to get there / get back home, the time always flies by and suddenly it is already evening and the sun is setting (which happens at 19:30 atm). So since we didn't want to waste any more time, we run to the river again and started directly at our front door. In the evening the streets are not crowded anymore and because of the street lights you are able to see everything, on the other hand it is really exhausting to have those altitudes and at the river we additionally saw a warning sign for snakes. Since we didn't want the risk to overlook one and then get bitten, we stayed at the streets and were kind of stressed the whole time. </p>
   <br>

   <p>On Saturday we wanted to do our long run and run for 8k. To decide where to go, we randomly looked at maps and found 'Yarra Bend Park'. We met there with Will (who wanted to start running more frequently again) and then just started at one edge. But soon we discovered that probably this park is not the best one for a long run because it had a lot of altitudes again (who would have thought that Melbourne is so hilly?!) and so we really had so look where to go next the whole time, which then made it really hard to find the right rhythm. In short: We were all struggeling BUT we still finished! The park itself was really beautiful though, so for going for a walk it seemed to be amazing. But probably we will not train there anymore</p>
   <br>


   <h3>Sunday, 08.10.2023</h3>
   <p>After yesterdays run which was more frustrating then fun, we wanted to do a second run in a better environment to have a good experience again. To get to their work, Viki and Laura always have to cross Fawkner Park (which I think is a very cool way to start the day btw when it is not raining they most of the time walk there) and they told me that the park is not special but quite nice and it only takes us 15min to get there.</p>

    <img src="./Pics_Running/Fawkne Park 2.jpg" alt="Fawkner Park 2" height="250px">
   <p>We then decided to go there for a 7k run in the evening and it was amazing. Since it is in the middle of the street you can see the lights of all the skyscrapers and one round is 2.5k, so for everything until 10k it is a really nice place to run (afterwards it might get to repetitive though).</p>
   <br>

   <h3>Wednesday, 11.10.2023</h3>
   <p>Today something weird happened: We all were really stressed with work + finishing the iGEM stuff and when we met at the flat we all really felt the need to go for a run to feel better! And that although Laura and Viki started their period. So we went to Fawkners park again and just ran 5k, so 2 rounds. We really need to focus on going for a run often but then at the same time to not extent our distance when we feel good, because our tendons andjionts have to get used to that new burden and otherwise we might injure ourselves pretty easy. </p>
   <br>

   <h3>Saturday, 14.10.2023</h3>
   <p>We had planned to meet with Ronja and Christina to do our long-run together with them, but then Laura and Viki wanted to stay at the keepers and finders market a bit longer, and so I met with the other ones on my own. Also Lauras knee still hurts, so a long run probably wouldn't have been got either way.</p>
   <p>On my way from the market to our flat the trains that I had to take to get in the right direction were not going at all and the public transport app kept ignoring that and suggested me the same train over and over again, so I had to find a solution on my own and then still only arrived 10 min later, which I think is quit okay for such a big city. We again went to Alberts Park, because this is still our all-time-favoured one to go running, and then Ronja and Christina told me that they were aiming for 12 km today (ufff), but very slowly. So I just spontaneous decided to join there run and I think I wouldn't have made it without them. That run just was not easy for me at all, maybe because I didn't eat enough, maybe because of the stressfull week, I don't know. I still finished though so I am very proud that apparenty I can already run for 12km after just 2 weeks of proper training.</p>

   <h3>Sunday, 15.10.2023</h3>
   <p>While Laura still needed a break because of her knee, Viki wanted to go for another run, because the one they did was "only" 6km on Saturday. In the beginning I thought she would go for 5km or something like that because after the hot springs we were all a bit tired, but since she didn't do it yesterday, she aimed for a long run and wanted to do 10km. We went to Fawkners Park again, just because it is so close by, and also one round is exactly 2,5km, so we could run perfectly for 4 rounds. I was kind of happy that we chose this park, because I had forgotten to wear my watch and so that was the only way to track the kilometers. This time it already felt so much easier and I can't believe I am able to run 10k in just over one hour and don't feel bad during and after it. And all that with only 2,5 weeks of training! So I am really optimistic right now that we will be able to run that half marathon in 7 weeks and still feel good while running!</p>
   <br>

   <h3>Tuesday, 17.10.2023</h3>
   <p>Lauras knee still hurts and Viki had to stay in the lab very long today, so I ran alone today. Like always during the week I went to Fawkners Park again, did 2 km as a warm-up and then tried to run 5 km as fast as possible. I managed to run those 5 km in 27:40 min with a pace of 5:40/km. My heart rate was often over 190bpm, but I somehow don't get any problems with breathing and having enough air any more. Also after finishing my heart rate went down to 135bom in 3 min, so I can already see some progress and feel very proud of myself.</p>

   <br>
   <h3>Sunday, 22.10.2023</h3>
   <p>Viki ran already in the morning, but because I needed to wait until public transport works again, I arrived later and so I went for a run on my own after breakfast. I did a long run again and went really slow, but managed to keep my heart rate down for nearly 12km. Then I had to stop because I needed to hurry to be able to go to the museum with the others, otherwise I might have been able to keep it up for some more kilometers.</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   <h3>Tuesday, 24.10.2023</h3>
   <p>Lauras knee is slightly better, so she wanted to come with us for a chill run at least. This time we went to Alberts Park again but splitted up so everybody could run the amount and speed whoever she wanted. I ran only 5km, but tried to be as fast as possible and managed to keep a 5:43min/km pace. Viki ran a bit slower but did 10km instead and Laura was able to run 4km with her knee, so that are great news!</p>
   <br>
   <br>
   <br>

   <h3>Tuesday, 31.10.2023</h3>
   <p>I felt slightly ill last weekend, so I had a one week break of training. But we kind of only have 5 weeks left, so it was really neccessary to finally do a long run again. Laura did 10 km and Viki and I both did 14 km. But in the end we both felt our muscles and also our knees and then in the night we bouth woke up because of knee pain. For me it was already a lot better the next day, but it is still scary to see how difficult it is for our joints to run for a long time. Also because only endurance wise, I feel like we would all be able to run the half marathon right now. But joint wise it remains a bit unclear. </p>
   <br>

    <h3>Sunday, 05.11.2023</h3>
    <p>After a night with a lot less sleep than my body would prefer, I went on a run alone in the evening. To make it faster I decided to run along Yarra River again and then went up until the Botanical Gardens. My watch did not have enough batterie to cature the whole run, but since I had to run back I can calculate it up to mybe 13km? I wore the bandage again and it really helped my left knee, so I am quite optimistic right now. My VO2 value also went up to 45 after the run, so I can really feel and measure improvement, which is really nice!</p>

    <br>

    <h3>Sunday, 12.11.2023</h3>
    <p>We kind of had planned to do this long run forever, but apparently it had been always Ronja and me and so the other ones did not really know about it. This weekend we were all together at Phillips Island (7 girls in total) and had said that this is the perfect opportunity to go all together for a long run. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Wednesday, 15.11.20223</h3>
    <p>I went home from work earlier today, because I had cramps (maybe I ate sth wrong?), but they were completely gone after I rested for a few hours. So I met with Will and Mitch at Alberts Park to go for a 5 km run together. We chatted for a while afterwards and then all went home again. But Alberts Park still is my favorite place for running.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Friday, 17.11.20223</h3>
    <p>I went for a run at Yarra river on my own again and was surprised by how fast I was. I managed to run 8 km with a pace of 5:42 min/km. I remember in the beginning when I started to run, everything faster than 6 min/km felt like dying and know I can stay within that speed without feeling bad for multiple kilometers.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>wednesday, 22.11.20223</h3>
    <p>Today I went for a run on my own again. Viki and Laura really have to stay in the lab very long rigt now, so often they don't arrive at home until 8 pm. I just went to Yarra River again and tried to find out how long I can run with a very high heart rate, so that I know when I can speed up at the half marathon. I ran 9 km with a pace of 5:23 min/km and felt extremely exhausted afterwards. But now I know that I can definitely run fast for the last 5 km of the half marathon.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Saturday, 29.11.20223</h3>
    <p>Last run before the half marathon. I just wanted to have an easy run, where I go really slow and just enjoy running. I met with Mitch and we ran along Brighton Beach, which kind of is even more beautiful than Alberts Park, because you also see the CBD in the background,but are at the beach and can jump into the water afterwards. Jono picked me up after the run, because we still wanted to drive to Peninsula in the evening and jumped into the water with us after the run.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Sunday, 03.12.20223: Half Marathon</h3>
    <p>After two month of training and everyone beeing injured from time to time, today was finally the big day of the half marathon. We all went to bed as early as possible (around 10 pm) and woke up at 5 am to make sure that we eat enough before the half marathon and also just to completely wake up. We had to take an Uber because there are no trams that early in the morning and got out of the house at 6 am to have one hour left. Originally we had planned to arrive early enough to be able to warm up etc., but obviously a lot of people tried to take the same route as we did and so there was a lot of traffic (the Uber driver was really convioused in the beginning). We managed to get there, go to the toilette again and leave our stuff at the baggage drop off just in time to meet Ronja and Christina and then the run directly started.</p>
    <p>We started completely in the end, because we didn't want to be in the way for runners that acutally want to get a new PB, which was great because then we could pass people instead of getting passed. In the beginning I ran together with Ronja and Viki and Laura and Christina went a little bit slower and we just chatted for a while. Then at about 10 km Viki said that she will go a little bit slower and so Ronja and I passed on and we stayed together until kilometer 16, when I had the feeling that I could still go a little bit faster and she felt like she needs to rest a little bit more. I also ate every 2-3 km during the race, most of the time gummibears that were handed out to the people, but also a whole oatbar.</p>
    <p>I arrived with a time of 2h10min with which I am extremely happy and then could wait for all the other ones to directly gratulate them. Ronja and Viki were duing fine, but when Christina arrived she struggled a little bit with her circulation, so we directly gave her something to eat and then she felt better very soon luckely.</p>
    <p>Vera and Kathi had came to the end to watch us, but arrived too late to see Ronja, Viki and me, but they saw Christina and then also Laura and sent pictures in our group and so we directly knew when Laura arrived and I got up to look for her. I was really worried about her, because her knee still hurted and also she hadn't trained for a month, so her even finishing was really impressive. But when I saw her she was crying and telling me that her knee hurts extremly bad and I felt so sorry for her that I nearly also started crying. But after a while she luckely felt a lot better and we all agreeed that from all of us she showed the most willpower fighting through the pain and finishing 21 km without proper training. But she really needs to go to a better doctor who actually finds out the right diagnosis. </p>
    <p>Afterwards we finished with sitting on the beach (Ronja and I obviously went for a swim) and then went back home. Two of my toenails don't look super happy though so I am not sure if they will actually stay or if I will loose them. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Wednesday, 13.12.2023</h3>
    <p>First run after the half marathon 1.5 weeks later. Jono, Will and I met Kim (a new friend of Will) at the beach to go for a run together. The three of us stayed together and talked a while while running, while Jono ran on his own (because he hates running, but decided he needs to start doing it for his endurance + heart). He always claims that he is not good in running and has no endurance but then he ran 8 km easily and also the fasted of all of us. I felt my left shin throughout the whole 8 km though (as a result of jumping at the festival), so I have to be a little bit careful that I don't get an inflammation I guess.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Friday, 15.12.2023</h3>
    <p>Jono and I got up at 6 am to do a small morning run in the small park next to their house. I ran for 4 km very slow and did not feel too good at all, but apparently my watch thinks I am doing great, because my VO2 got up to 46. I had to stopp after 4 km because of my shin though and will probably take a week of running and look for exercises for my shin instead, so that stopps hurting before it gets really bad. Really sad because I love morning runs and really want to include them more often, but if I stopp running now I can hopefully start in the next year again.</p>
