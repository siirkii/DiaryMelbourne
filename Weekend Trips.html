    <h3>Sunday, 08.10.2023: Lysterfield Park</h3>
    <p>We were really lucky that Will after knowing us for only the run on Saturday directly offered to pick us up at his train station with his car and to drive us to Lysterfield Park. He had told me before that there you are able to hike and also see kangaroos - and that only a 30min drive away (with public transport it takes up to 2h in comparison). We arrived at the park and there we met his roommate Jono and his parents. Apparently they go there each Sunday to go hiking and the only weekends they don't is when they do some weekend trips to mountains that are more far away. It was really amazing to meet them because he could give us a lot of tips where we could go next and what areas we could also reach with public transport. So hopefully we have some trips coming up soon.</p>
    <p> The park itself is really beautiful. The trees here in Melbourne just look so different compared to those in Germany, a lot lighter mostly. And also Monstera and other plant that we can only keep indoors in Germany just go here everywhere. The next thing that is just different is of course the wild life: Especially birds not only have really different looks but especially their sound is something completely new. </p>

    <p>We then went uphill directly and on our way really saw three kangaroos!! One really big one with probably her two children(?). We just stood there and were really amazed and the others that see them every weekend were a bit amazused by that. After a while the kangaroos jumped away and we continued our way to the top where we then could watch some birds fighting with each other (we later on learned that they also can really hurt humans and even kill children but luckely nothing happened) and then saw something really rare and special: An Echidna!! Will told us that he also only had seen them 3-4 times in his lifes so we were really lucky I guess. We then watched it for almost half an hour and he Echidna was not scared at all apparently because he just walked around and scratched himself with all four legs.</p>

    <p>On our way back downhill, we then also found a batagame that was too cold to move but still alive! And when I picked it up to hold it (just remembered me of the ones I had as a child so much) it got warm enough again and then jumped out of my hand. All in all it was a really nice tip and we are really happy we managed to see that many animals!</p>

    <h3>Sunday, 15.10.2023: Peninsula Hotsprings </h3>
    <p>Today we had to get up really early (early enough that there wasn't any public transport and we had to take an Uber) to be at Huntingdale station at 6:15 where Will and Jono then picked us up with their car to go to Peninsula Hotsprings with us. We already bought tickets in advance (~40€ but definitly worth it) and so we could easily enter. The hotsprings itself are crazy beatufil. There are really a lot of differnt pools which all have 36-42°C and also some cold-plunge pools which are then 18-20°C.</p>
    <img src="./Pics_Trips/Peninsula Hotsprings/Hotspring Trail.jpg" alt="Hotspring general 1" height="250px">
    <img src="./Pics_Trips/Peninsula Hotsprings/Hotspring general 1.jpg" alt="Hotspring general 2" height="250px">
    <p>We directly went up to the one that is on top of the hill and the view was just amazing. Apparently it is also the most famous one and you can find it all over instergram, but since it was only 7:30 am nobody was in there and we had the pool and the view just by ourselves. In the beginning we could also not stay in there for a long time in a row, and also the first time trying a cold plunge was extremely cold, but after a while my body just got used to it and then it was really easy to move back and forth between them.</p>
    <img src="./Pics_Trips/Peninsula Hotsprings/Hotspring Panorama 2.jpg" alt="Panorama 2" height="250px">

    <img src="./Pics_Trips/Peninsula Hotsprings/Hotspring Panorama.jpg" alt="Panorama 1" height="250px">
    <p>In the beginning we just went to various pools, but there wee also different kind of Saunas (dry and wet ones) and a cold room with -25°C that looked like a cave and in which you could stay for a few minutes before going back to the next hot pool. We did it three times and then philosophized why this is good for our immune system (and of course came up with various ideas but also pointa of criticism why those studies might be hard to be exact) and also just shivered a lot. But we always reminded ourselves that we paid for it and so we stayed </p>
    <p>In total we stayed until 1 pm so 5,5 hours and then became really hungry because we only had oatsbars as breakfast. We then headed directly to the beach where we bought some vegetarian burgers and fries with amazing melted cheese on top. I don't know when the it was the last time that I was so hungry so the food tasted amazing. Afterwards we directly went for a coffee and it was again pretty good, but so far nothing could compare to the coffeeshop that we have at work. The coffeeshop was located in front of a really cute shop with a lot of selfmade stuff so we went inside and looked around and they had the cutest baby clothes I've ever seen and also some postcards with drawn animals on it for Viki. Viki is trying to find postcards with photographs of Melbourne since we arrived, but weirdly we can't find any and Melbourne is a really touristic place. It seems like Australians probably don't like to write postcards?</p>

    <img src="./Pics_Trips/Peninsula Hotsprings/Laura+Viki (2).jpg" alt="Laura and Viki" height="250px">
    <p>After lunch Jono wanted to go for a swim in the ocean (it had around 18°C btw) and so we drove to another place called 'London Bridge' that they described to us as "beach with a stone with a hole". We then did not think about that any further and just expected a normal beach (which is also already really beautiful with the white sand and turquise water), but when we arrived we were all really shocked by how beautiful that place is. Also it was really empty. We stayed there for probably ~45 min and only saw two other groups going for a walk. Of course the weather was not great, but right now I am still surprised by how empty beaches are close to Melbourne. Since Australia is a really common place to travel to, I expected it to be way more crowded. But maybe that will change in the summer, let's see.</p>

    <p>The car-drive back home was really funny, we all were in high spirits and made a lot of dumb jokes all together. Jono then even drove us home, because for people that grew up in Melbourne half an hour detour apparently is not that much. And because those two are just really kind people of course.</p>

    <h3>Saturday, 21.10.2023: Dandenong Ranges</h3>
    <p>It was not easy to find a date and time so that everybody could join, but we then finally decided on Saturday, starting around 10am. In total we were 7 people, Laura, Viki, Ronja, Christina, Vera and Mitch. We wanted to meet in the train, but then I guided Laura and Viki to the wrong side of the train station and so we missed it and arrived half an hour later then the rest. We then directly met at Dandenong Ranges Train Station and while waiting Vera got to know the others without us introducing them (I guess not so many people arrive by train to then first thing just chill there for half an hour).</p>
    <p>Ronja had searched for a hike we wanted to do, which began with the famous "1000 step walk" and then afterwards a normal hike for the rest of the 9 km. The 1000 steps walk is called like that, because it only consists out of Steps (but luckely not 1000 in total) and a lot of people drive there to only do that part. It really looked like a rainforest and also the humidity was equal (itwas a really sweaty experience), but the plants just were amazing. For me it felt like I would be in a botanical garden but those plants just grow here on their own. Later on we again saw Echidnas, in total three of them! I am starting to believe that the "Oh they are so rare you are so lucky" we got from Will the first weekend might have been a lie!</p>
    <img src="./Pics_Trips/1000steps/1.JPG" height="250px">
    <img src="./Pics_Trips/1000steps/2.JPG" height="250px">
    <img src="./Pics_Trips/1000steps/4.JPG" height="250px">
    <p>Also everybody else except us brought some food (mostly carrots though) and then shared them with us. The only thing I brought again was water, but you don't really need it here because every ten minutes is a stop with a water dispenser. So the next time I will not bring 1.5l, but maybe a bottle that fits less and just refill it from time to time.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Saturday, 28.10.2023: Great Ocean Road</h3>
    <p>This morning started very chaotic (kind of as always) with us leaving way to late and nearly missing our tram because we were stuck in discussions about marriage. We managed to get the tram and then continued our talk which as a result let us to missing our stop, hecticly getting out one stop later and me forgetting my phone in the tram. Which I directly discovered, but the tram still already was gone. So instead of looking forward to our trip, we panicked, tried to call the PTV, fill out forms and write them on twitter, where they directly answered and then also informed me that my phone was found, but I could only pick it up on monday, so I spend the weekend having a phone-detox (which turned out to be great except for the fact that I always pay over my phone and had my myki card (for public transport) in the bag between phone and case).</p>
    <p>We then managed to get into the bus on time and started our trip. The trip was from an organization, but since we all don't have a car, that sounded like a good opportunity to be at least able to see the great ocean road. Vera was also joining us, and all the four of us sat on the left side of the bus and therefore were able to have a look at the ocean while we were driving.</p>
    <p>The trip itself had multiple stops and the first one was at the chocolate fabric at the start of the great ocean road where we bought coffee and scones and croissants and then ate them in the bus on our way to the next stop. Everything tasted amazing, but I enjoyed the scone the most because it had been ages since I last tried one. As for coffee we also took one that had more chocolate in it and afterwards I felt like I definitly had too much sugar, but that's fine.</p>
    <img src="./Pics_Trips/Great Ocean Road/scone.JPG" height="250px">
    <p>The next stop then was the beginning of the great ocean road with the memorial arch. We decided to go directly to the beach though and the water was really christal clear (but this often seems to be the case somehow). One downside of the trip was that we always only had a certain time at the stops, most of the time about 30 min and so it always felt like we would be in a hurry. Afterwards we drove to another stop at the seaside to a small city where you could buy lunch, but since I had the whole scone for breakfast I wasn't hungry and so we just sat at the beach and enjoyed the view. Vera dipped her feet into the water, which I was very jealous about later on, because this was the last stop where it was possible, but I did not know that at the moment.</p>
    <img src="./Pics_Trips/Great Ocean Road/lunch.JPG" height="250px">
    <img src="./Pics_Trips/Great Ocean Road/cuddle seaside.JPG" height="250px">
    <p>The next stop then was at a camping side, where we only stopped because you can see koalas there and there really were two of them plus a lot of colourful birds. It is kind of in the nature (I think the whole area is a nationalpark), but since those two koalas were directly in the front, I wonder if they get fed there so tourists are able to find them easily. I still really loved it, because I had never seen a koala before. I kind of thought they would be bigger, but maybe there are also different kinds of koalas? I definitly have to loook that up.</p>
    <img src="./Pics_Trips/Great Ocean Road/koala.JPG" height="250px">
    <p>Afterwards we went to a rainforest and took a walk there and while I've been in rainforests now more then once, I still think that is one of the most beautiful things to see. But also here again we had to hurry because there was a short and a longer route and he said if we would want to take the longer one we would really need to hurry up (which we then did). At this point the strict time was really sad, because we really felt the pressure of beeing as fast as possible, not taking a lot of picutres or just standing still for a moment to enjoy the view. The good thing about the tour though was that the group leader of course knew a lot about the history and also was quite funny and so during the rides he told us a lot of things about nature and ship wrecks.</p>

    <img src="./Pics_Trips/Great Ocean Road/rainforest+people.JPG" height="250px">
    <p>Afterwards we had two stops to go, one was a view point where apparently a ship sank a lot of years ago, and then afterwards the twelf apostels. The scenery was stunning, but also kind of looked like portugal and the wind was so strong that at some point it was freezing and also Laura had troubles breathing (but the rest of us did not, and we just did a group hug to warm us up, so it was really okay). In total it still was a really nice day and we were really lucky with the weather, but next time I definitly want to go there on my own and also for two days.</p>

    <h3>Sunday, 29.10.2023: Mornington Peninsula</h3>
    <p>After yesterday you might think that we started to manage our time better, but of course we were again to late and so when we arrived at the train station to drive to huntingdale station where Will and Jono would pick us up, we discovered that it was not only me who didn't have a PTC card, but also Viki forgot hers and Laura forgot her phone at home, which also led her to not having her PTV card (because it is also in the back like mine). We then decided that we never got controlled and we would just drive there without having one and also we have a monthly pass, so it is not like we would "steal" money from the compan. When the train then arrived, we saw that officiers were inside and we started panicking and just looked at them and were starting to discuss if we should get inside or not (but if not, how should we inform Jono and Will because I am the only one who has their numbers on the phone) and while still beeing in the middle of discussions, the officers oped us the door because they apparently thought we would just not know how to open them. And so we went inside and of course as soon as the doors were closted they came to us and wanted to check our PTV cards. But none of us had it with them. We atarted to explain our various problems to them and the women that thank god said that she will not report us (otherwise everybody would have paid 290$), but that we have to get out the next station. So we got out the next station and then stood there and discussed what to do. Then we came up with the idea to write the boys on instagram over Vikis phone and ordered an Uber to the station, but Will directly replied that they will pick us up and so we deleted the Uber request again (which is also really uncomfortable).They then were there in less then 10 minutes and just laughed with us and said next time they will just pick us op at our flat and then we finally drove to Mornington Peninsula National Park, to start our hike.</p>
    <img src="./Pics_Trips/Mornington Peninsula/sea beginning.JPG" height="250px">
    <img src="./Pics_Trips/Mornington Peninsula/path.JPG" height="250px">
    <img src="./Pics_Trips/Mornington Peninsula/path 2.JPG" height="250px">
    <p>Jono had looked a 14 km hike where we first went to a lighthouse where you also had a really nice view at the sea and potentially also could have gone bathing. THe whole hike our goal was to manage to get a picture of Jono, but it is very difficult because he keeps moving his head away (he says that it is kind of a game for him). We also had "lunch" there, which only means some oat bars, almonds and karrots, because no one had brought a real meal. Will also made a nice polaroid picture of Viki, Laura and me and then we went back to get to another stop at the ocean where we wanted to go swimming.</p>
    <img src="./Pics_Trips/Mornington Peninsula/view.JPG" height="250px">
    <p>Luckely Jono had packed a lot of sunscreen, because I had to use it every hour (also on my arms!) to not get burned completely. All the others managed to use less sunscreen and still did not get burned, so I really don't know what is wrong with my skin. </p>

    <img src="./Pics_Trips/Mornington Peninsula/girls.JPG" height="250px">
    <img src="./Pics_Trips/Mornington Peninsula/Laura+Viki.JPG" height="250px">
    <p>While it was very hot the whole day, when we arrived at 4 pm at the other stop the sun was not as strong anymore and so Viki, Laura and I started freezing a little bit. Viki also lost the polaroid picture she had made and then started to look for it at the beach but could not find it again. There were a lot of black rocks where you could climb up and they formed some kind of plateaus where we laid down in the sun and just napped a bit. Then we finally wanted to go bathing and instead of jumping directly into the ocean, we used the rock pools that were there. There was one large and really deep one, but there were alsready some other people, so we went to a small one first. Laura did not join us because she was already to cold, but Viki and I really wanted to do it because when would be the next time where we have the chance to do it?</p>
    <img src="./Pics_Trips/Mornington Peninsula/sea+Jono.JPG" height="250px">
    <p>The water was freezing cold and Viki in I stayed in there for maybe 20 seconds and also did not get our hair wet, but then Jono and Will came and said we really should check out the deep one because you can jump inside and the water is cristal clear and so we of course had to do it. Afterwards we all could not stop shivering for a while and especially I took forever to get warm again (Jono gave me his jumper and Will his towel to wrap it around me and it was still to cold), but I think that was mainly because we did not eat enough.</p>
    <p>Afterwards we really had to go back and on the way to the car we saw two kangaroos crossing the small path and one directly looked at us!</p>
    <p>Lastly we went to Huntingdale Station to get some food there for all of us and then the boys drove us back home and we only cooked curry for the next day and then directly fell asleep.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Weekend 03.-5.11.2023: Grampians the (hopefully) 1st</h3>
    <p>It felt very unreal to get home after work on Friday knowing that we will go camping the same day. Maybe also because we really did not need to plan anything, Jono kind of organized everything by himself, got camping gear from his parents, packed all the stuff we would need and Will had picked up warm clothes for the three of us at his parents house before. So we just packed our clothes and cameras and were ready to go. Laura was feeling a little bit overwhelmed, because she has had a lot to do for work that week and also will have a prettx stressful week coming up, but then when she heared that we will be back early on Sunday she felt a lot better and we could start our journey.</p>
    <p>The guys picked us up and then we went to Coles first to go grocery shopping for the weekend and Laura beeing hungry pannicked and so we bought way too much food (but everything is amazing and we can still use the rest of it for the next week) and payed 180$ in total. Viki and I also bought different flavours of Mochi icecream and then we went to a noodle place and got some food. The did have every dish also as an vegetarian option with tofu, which was great, but did not have a toilette. I keep forgetting that it is only a german law that every place that sells food and where you aditionally can sit down has to have a toilette.</p>
    <p>The rest of the car drive all of us girls just slept and Will stayed awake with Jono. When we finally woke up we had arrived in the grampians and the first stop we of course did was a toilette stop. BUT it took us a while to get to the toilette because directly in front of it were A LOT of kangaroos eating grass, jumping around and also fighting (very inefficient with kicking with both legs simultaneously and nearly falling while doing it and apparently judging the efficiency of kangaroo's fighting skills is a very german thing to do).</p>
    <p>Afterwards we set up our tent (mostly Jono but at least we helped a little bit) and then found out that with "stretchers" he meant the german "Feldbetten" and so we did not sleep on the ground (except Jono because he likes it more). Then he came up with the idea to go for a midnight swim and since it "still" had 10°C, we decided that it sounds like a great idea and then went to some small river that flows through some rocks and therefore has some rock pools at the side. Everybody except Laura went inside,and afterwards I directly put a blanket around Viki and me to heat us up again. Then we went back to our camp and Jono showed me his favorite climbs (we did not do them in the darf of course but they were on the way). When we came back to the tent(around 2:30am) we all were very happy about our warm sleepingbags, but we did not had in mind that stretchers sound really cool in the beginning, but are way to cold to actually use them when it has 8°C, because they don't isolate at all.</p>
    <p>So the next morning began with all of us (except Jono again of course whos body produces crazy amounts of body heat) telling each other how cold we were last night. But luckely it got warmer outside and so we packed our stuff and then drove to a small village in the grampians to get coffee first. When we had the coffee Jono asked me if I would want to go bouldering today and of course I wanted, but then remembered that I left my shoes and chalk in our tent, so he was so kind to drive me back in order to collect the things and the other ones waited there in the sun.</p>
    <p>When we came back we found them watching a kangaroo family and I saw a baby kangaroo for the first time (well more of the legs and tail and sometimes the head because it was in the pouch of the mother). The father was very aggressive, probably because he wanted to protect his child, and always scared away another kangaroo that wanted to join. Laura, Will and Viki then came up with some weird names and a story about the kangaroos in which apparently the one kangaroo that kept coming back to the family was the disowned son-in-law.</p>
    <p>We then drove to ..... and had a short hike to a boulder area where you also had a great view over a gigantic lake. Laura and Viki searched for some sun on the rocks and started reading and Will and I were climbing and Jono was explaining us what to do and spotted us. Beeing very optimistic about the temperature, we all had brought to less clothes and it was a bit windy so I took Jonos jumper (addendum: now he says everything that has a hood is called hoodie, but I swear he called it jumper the whole weekend) for climbing which resulted in him beeing kind of cold but saying it is maximum a little uncomfortable and he would not call it freezing.</p>
    <p>On the way back to the car everyone tried to fall backwards with the crushpad on. I call it "trying" because it feels really odd and is not as easy as it maybe sounds and so it took us multiple attempts to feel more comfortable. Then we really had to hurry up to get some food for the evening, because we wanted to see the ........... falls before it was completely dark. We arrived just in time to run down the hundrets of stairs to see it before the sun was completely gone (only for a few minutes though because we were obviously late as always). The good thing about visiting places when it is nearly dark is that nobody else was there, so we layed down and watched it for a bit.</p>
    <p>The of course we needed to go for our midnight swim again and Jono wanted to go to a waterfall where we had to hike to first, so until we arrvied it was already 10:30pm again. He jumped straight into the water, but because of the long hair I was afraid it would never dry again and so I only climbed in for maybe 30 seconds. This time Laura also went inside and afterwards she also admitted that it was amazing and you feel a lot fresher afterwards.</p>
    <p>This night we all put on more clothes and used the blankets to insolate the stretchers and therfore managed that noone was freezing this night. We only slept 4h though, because we wanted to have a sunrise hike. We packed our stuff, some things so breakfast, headlamps and our sleepingbags to be cozy on top of the mountain. But then we were too slow so we had to stop earlier and watch the sunrise from anouther viewpoint then we planned for (but not less beautiful). The only sad thing was that I forgot to put my contact linses in, so everything was a little bit blurred. But  I still enjoyed it and thanks to my camera, I was also able to see it sharper over pictures.</p>
    <p>We then got coffee and drove up to the north of the grampians, where the famous big climbing wall is. Will, Viki and Laura read again and drank some gin tronic with fresh mango and I tried to boulder again (very ineffective though because of the lack of sleep). Jono helped me again a lot and then in the end we all chilled on the crash pad, I also got some gin and then we went home so Jono would be back "only" two hours to late for Markus birthday (he hates huge amounts of people and most of the time tries to avoid them).</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>Weekend 11.11.2023-12.11.2023: Phillips Island</h3>
    <p>This weekend was a complete girls trip: We rented a car for seven people and an appartment for one day and then drove to phillip's island. Viki was the only one with an international driving license and so she had to drive us to the island. And she did really great if you take into account that everyone here drives on the left (the first few curver we all screamt "Stay left, stay left" the whole time until she got used to it a bit more).</p>
    <p>We arrived around 1 pm on the island and directly went to the sea to just take a walk and look for shells. What is really fascinating so far is that most of the time you are pretty alone at the beach. It was only one other couple there which took marriage-pictures, so we tried to get out of their way, but that was very easy because the whole beach was just empty.</p>
    <p>After a while we all got very hungry and Ronja then asked the appartment if we could check in earlier and luckely we were allowed to do so. So we left all our stuff there and went grocery shopping and had lunch break with a lot of cherrys, bred, feta and fruits outside. It was still pretty cold though, so I wore at least one jumper the whole weekend, often more than one. In the early evening we went to the pinnacle lookout, which was beautiful but also very crowded and for that I did not like it too much. And also a lot of birds that were kind of aggressive and so we had to be really careful with eating our oat bars and not getting attacked by them.</p>
    <p>In the evening we went to the famous pinguin parade, where hundrets of very small penguins (apparently the smallest ones in the whole world) get out of the water and enter the island. It was really magical but also extremely cold and nobody was allowed to even have their phones out so the penguins would not get disturbed by the light, which I think is a great compromise between showing people the wildlife, but also making sure it is protected. Because I couldn't take pictures, I have uploaded a link where you can see professional pictures they took.</p>
    <p>The next day we did a hike around the island and I personally enjoyed that a lot more than the hike yesterday, because the nature was still as beautiful but soooo less people in general. It was very windy though and also a bit cold, which was not a problem for me (because of the crazy amount of jumpers I brought), but Christina did not feel too good from time to time. Also I got to comfortable with the whole deadly snakes / spiders situation. Will and Jono had told me that snakes normally don't like humans and so try to stay away from paths and as long as you make enough sounds you are good to go. So I just started with singing whenever I have to leave the path and that is exactly what I did when I needed to pee. And it worked great (like always), but then 5 min later we saw a big snake directly next to the path! And we were absolutely not quite (like always when Laura is part of the group haha). So now I have to overthink my whole singing-strategy.</p>
    <p>On the way back home we drove past a chocolate factory and of course had to get there to by a Mocchachino. It is great that Viki shares my love for coffee for the same extend that I do. Then we drove back to Melbourne.</p>

    <h3>Sunday, 26.11.2023: Great Ocean Road </h3>
    <p>While I titled it with "Sunday" the trip already started Saturday evening with Jono and me driving to a camping spot close to the Great Ocean Road. Originally we had planned to get up very early on Sunday and then try to walk as many kilometers as possible, but after my fall on Saturday, he had directly decided that if we would still continue with our plan to go there, we would not set an alarm and only do a normal easy hike the next day. So that is exactly what we did. I had already slept in the car on our way going there and then Jono built up his tent and we directly went to sleep. </p>
    <p>The next day I still woke up at 6:30 am and since Jono never sleeps he of course also was already awake. We still continued to lay around and just chat for one hour and then quickly packed everything together, watched a lot of kangaroos (or they watched us instead, not too sure about that) and ate donuts for breakfast. Since I still could not move my arm properly, Jono did everything on his own again and then we parked the car and started our walk.</p>
    <p>The hike we had planned was the last day of the Great Ocean Road multiple day hike, so we started at the camp ground and then walked up to the 12 Apostels and then back again. The weather was cloudy and it rained from time to time, but we both agreed that this is the best weather for hiking. I am still really surprised how less people you always meet on touristic places like that. But probably most people go by car instead and the hike is less popular. I can't really understand this, but better for us so I will not complain. We walked 20 km in total and then drove back home to Melbourne. But of course we can't go near the sea without stopping for a swim, so we stopped at another beach, which was not that great for getting into the ocean, but had the most colorful rocks I had ever seen and also some old anchors from ship wrecks. Like how can you have beaches with old anchors and nobody is there? It feels like that would normally be a tourist attraction, but there are so less people in Australia that you can be alone at the most beautiful places.  </p>
